  - Make sure to add the following environment variables:
    - **ANDROID_HOME**: Add the directory where the Android SDK is located, for example: **C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk**.
    - Then respecting the order add these environment variables:

      - **%ANDROID_HOME%**\platform-tools
      - **%ANDROID_HOME%**\tools
      - **%ANDROID_HOME%**\tools\bin
  - Starting the emulator from the command line:

    - Iniciar el emulador:
      - emulator @emulator_name
    - As an alternative to any error it can be started with the following command: **%ANDROID_HOME%**\emulator\emulator.exe -avd <emulator_name>
- **Appium Doctor**: To validate that we have everything necessary to carry out our mobile tests, we must install and execute.

  - npm install -g appium-doctor
    - This will install the utility that will allow us to validate that everything is correctly configured.
  - appium-doctor --android
    - If we have correctly carried out all the steps above with this command, a success message and some warnings will be displayed.
    - In case of a blocking error, it will be displayed on the screen, it must be corrected and re-executed until everything is ok.

- APK to test.
  - We use for the example [the apk](https://github.com/webdriverio/native-demo-app/releases/download/v0.4.0/Android-NativeDemoApp-0.4.0.apk) provided by WebdriverIO.
  - You can run the following from the command line as an alternative:
    - curl <https://github.com/webdriverio/native-demo-app/releases/download/v0.4.0/Android-NativeDemoApp-0.4.0.apk> --output Android-NativeDemoApp-0.4.0.apk
  - For the example to work, the apk must be inside the folder **/app** in the base of our project with the name configured in the capability **app** of the file [*codecept.conf.js*](codecept.conf.js).
